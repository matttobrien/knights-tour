# KnightPuzzle
Prolog program that finds a knight's path on a given N*N chessboard, where N is an input. It starts from the fixed location (1,1), then visits each square once. There are two files, 'knightPuzzle', which is a naive solution that tries any possible position, while 'warnsdorffKnightPuzzle' utilizes Warnsdorff's rule heuristic to find the best possible knight's path. Compile using swi-prolog or gprolog.
